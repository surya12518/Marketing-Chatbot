## üè¢ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **MarketGen GenAI Rollout**, where our goal was to integrate **Generative AI capabilities** into the existing marketing analytics workflow.  
The system enables marketers to **chat with their data**, retrieve campaign insights, analyze performance, and compare results ‚Äî all in a conversational interface powered by **Google Gemini** and **LangChain**.

---

## üß† Core Objectives

- Build a **marketing chatbot** with conversational memory.  
- Enable **document-based question answering (RAG)** over campaign briefs and brand manuals.  
- Extend RAG with **memory and multi-step query retrieval**.  
- Create an **SQL QA system** for campaign and customer data.  
- Implement a **summarization engine** for marketing reports and survey feedback.  
- Develop **workflow automation** with n8n for business process automation.
